There is a growing number of passionate cricketers who do not get an opportunity to participate in these leagues and compete with the younger generation. In order to create a level playing field and allow participation across all age groups, TCCC mandates that in every playing XI, a maximum of three (3) players can be below the age of twenty-eight (28) years will be allowed in a game. All other players in the playing XI must be 28 years of age or older. The cut-off date for this age qualification is Dec 31, 2015. In other words, for a player to qualify as a 28+ player, he has to have a birthdate of Dec 31, 1987 or earlier. Any player that does not qualify as a 28+ player, will automatically be considered a “youth” player i.e. below 28 years of age.          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of each match, the Captain will submit the Match Sheet as usual to the Umpire. From the 11 + 1 = 12 names listed on the match sheet, a maximum of three (3) players can be “youth” players. These two names will be clearly indicated by the Captain on the match sheet by writing the word “youth” next to that player’s name. No team will be permitted to have more than three (3) youth players in the 12 names submitted on a match sheet. All age verifications will be carried out in tandem with the team captains and managers at the start of the season as part of the registration process. </p>          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">This will be implanted as a honor system. If any teams captain believes that the opposing team has contravened this provision, they will raise a written complaint with the TCCC Board and secretary. At no time will the captains or players attempt to stop the game from proceeding further. The board will review the matter and decided on a appropriate course of action for any team that is found guilty of breaking this rule. </p>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 15px;text-align: left;">          <h3 style="color: #005D97 !important;font-size: 18px !important;">12th Man Rule</h3>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">          <p style="text-align: justify;">TCCC Tournament will enable the 12th man to play as a substitute, based on the following guidelines:</p>          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of each match, the Captain while submitting the Match Sheet as usual to the Umpire will list 11 + 1 = 12 names on the match sheet, one player will be designated as the 12th man on the Match Sheet. Alternatively, the Captain can choose to list only 11 names on the Match Sheet and not have a 12th man. The 12th man will be allowed to field as a substitute during the game, in any position, except wicket-keeper. The fielding Captain will inform the Umpire before swapping a fielder with the 12th man; and before swapping back the 12th man for the fielder. The Captain does not have to provide the Umpire with any reason for doing so.</p>          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the 12th man can bowl during the match at any time in the innings. Captains will have be judicious in the use of their 12th man. If one of the 11 players leaves the field or does not take to the field, he cannot bowl until he returns and fields for the same number of overs that he was off for. Similarly, if during the first inning, any player leaves the field during the last few overs, he cannot come in to bat until the same numbers of overs have been bowled.</p>          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">The 12th man cannot bat or keep wickets.</p>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 15px;text-align: center;background: #F0F8FF;height: 35px;padding: 7px 0px 0px 5px;border-radius: 5px;">          <p style="color: #003e64 !important;font-size: 15px;font-weight: bold;text-align: left;">OFFICIATING THE GAMES</p>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">          <p style="text-align: justify;">TCCC Board will nominate a panel of umpires to officiate in the league matches. These umpires are paid professionals and are accountable for officiating the games in a neutral and non-controversial manner. The umpire’s decision on the field is final. All teams should strictly adhere to this guideline. Any form of protest on the field will be treated as dissent and the TCCC board shall have the right to take appropriate action. In order to keep costs manageable, each team should provide an individual as a leg-umpire for their innings while they are batting. When in doubt leg umpires are required to consult the main umpire for any decisions. </p>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 15px;text-align: left;">          <h3 style="color: #005D97 !important;font-size: 18px !important;">PENALTIES FOR NO SHOW AND LATE CANCELLATIONS</h3>        </div>        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">          <p style="text-align: justify;">Our officials’ (Umpire & Scores) provide their availability to the league in advance.

The teams should return these balls to the umpire at the end of each innings. TCCC encourages the teams to label and save these balls. When a ball is damaged beyond the usual or lost during the course of an innings, these used balls that are labelled and saved should be made available to the umpires by the teams.</p>          <br/>          <p style="text-align: justify;">When a ball is lost in the first 5 overs, the fielding team will notify the umpire and provide a second new ball.

There is no limit on the number of “Youth Players” that can be registered in the roster, subject to the rule that no more than three (3) players will be allowed in any given game.
